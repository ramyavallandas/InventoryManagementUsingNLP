# InventoryManagementUsingNLP
This Application does all the actions like adding/deleting categories and products viewing products by voice commands. 


#INTRODUCTION 

#Background Information: 

In my undergraduate, I used to handle my father's business as a cashier. During those days, I noted a problem with the stock records. My father used to maintain the records manually, which led to many issues like losing the record book and missing the data or pages from the record book. It was challenging to locate a particular category and item. As an older man, he faced a lot of stress on his eyes while entering the data/records or searching for them. Weekly once, my father used to get the stocks from the wholesale market and maintain a handwritten record book with the list of categories and items/products. He added and deleted products accordingly and analyzed what should be following the week's stock list. He used to explore all the product information and market value on record bases. It used to take hours to do the whole process, which consumed a lot of time and energy. It requires a lot of concentration, and it's the same default for an older man to do all. Then, I got the idea to make an application that could solve all the problems. 

Like this, many local business people need help to make their lives more manageable. Most local business people are illiterate and know only their native language. Most business people with 25-plus years of experience in their particular industry need help to maintain the records but can't because they are used to the old method of writing the papers in the book. They can't hire anyone and have complete knowledge about their industry. Most business people prefer to analyze their records to analyze the business pattern. Data is the key to the business. Most of them are older men who are already facing health issues where they can't be able to spend a lot of time, but it's their passion for doing business, and it's been their primary income source for many years. 

So, in many countries, local businesses require a proper management system to store their secure data records. This issue can resolve many problems and provide many benefits to business people. They can analyze their data quickly and update them anytime within seconds. Security is also needed. The manual data records are not all secure. Most of the time, the records/data can be misplaced or lost. 

Covid time many businesses were down due to many different issues. Most business people must understand and realize the importance of the digital medium. The internet has taken over where things are. During covid time, most businesses started online businesses and left safe, easy-to-reach customers. Small companies that had closed for almost six months had realized the changes in the market and were ready to accept the shift in improving their business to get back on track. 

After finding this issue, from my own experience as a businessman's daughter, I got this idea to solve it, which could be helpful for many local small businesses. I wanted to solve this issue so that all local business people can happily manage their records anytime. 

I have always wanted to be a software engineer in big tech companies like FAAMG. I worked as a Full Stack Developer at DBS Bank (Singapore). I have good programming knowledge as a computer science student in my undergraduate. I have learned many skills which led me to this position. I like to upskill my knowledge. I think this project will be a great idea to start with Angular, Rest API calls, and NLP. I will get a closer view of the complete development process as I was doing it individually during this project development process. In contrast, my final graduate project was group one. I'm excited to do this project to learn things and implement them in my ideas. 

 

 

#OBJECTIVES 

 

#Problems: 

Local business people track all the data regarding their storage products IN/OUT of their storage. 

Many illiterate business people need help maintaining and managing all their data. 

An application can help many people who do not know how to use a computer. 

Manual data records get lost very frequently. 

It's a lot of work, time-consuming, and needs staffing. 

I have investigated the above problems and come up with a solution. I want to look for better solutions in the future. 

#Achieve: 

Small business people can easily manage the data records in the SAYIT application. 

SAYIT does all the actions like adding/deleting categories and products viewing products by voice commands. 

It's easy to manage inventory through voice commands. 

There will be no loss of data records. 

This application could help many local businesses. 

It helps business people who can't operate a computer. 

An application which is user friendly and easy to use. Cost less.  

 

 

 

#APPROACHES USED TO ACHIEVE THE OBJECTIVES  

Inventory Management using Natural Language Processing (NLP) 

The backend is a Rest API that accepts chatbot commands and decides appropriate action using NLP 

DialogFlow is a natural language understanding platform used to design and implement NLP.  

Creating a similar Alexa skill and integrating it into Spring Boot Server.  

A Telegram Gateway(API) in Spring Boot Application that allows users to communicate with the application directly. 

The front will be having a Chatbot Screen that takes in voice commands. Another Screen shows all the inventory and management capabilities.
